# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Repository structure

- Migrated ESP-IDF port from the `beta-reference-esp-port` branch of
  `awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-c` into this standalone
  repository. The upstream SDK is now a git submodule with platform patches
  applied via `git am patches/*.patch`.

### Added

- **SDP re-negotiation** — re-offer from the same peer re-uses an active
  session or replaces a terminated one.
- **BLE Wi-Fi provisioning** via the `network_provisioning` component in a
  shared `app_common/app_wifi_prov` module. Supported on ESP32-S3, ESP32-C6,
  and ESP32-P4 (BLE on C6 coprocessor through `esp_hosted`).
- **Split-mode enhancements** — bridge command framework with protobuf
  chunking, ICE server bridge for TURN credential sharing, light-sleep
  integration, snapshot over the bridge with SPIRAM-preferred payloads.
- **`simple_video_server` example** — standalone HTTP MJPEG / snapshot server
  with no WebRTC dependency.
- **Frame preprocess hook** — callback for raw frames before H.264 encoding.
- **Ring buffer peek API** — made public with peek support.
- **Kconfig stack sizes and signaling init retry** with exponential backoff;
  WebSocket stale-event guard and timeout race hardening.
- **ESP Launchpad integration** for `esp_camera` on ESP32-S3 — one-click
  browser flashing via GitHub Pages. `launchpad.toml` is generated with
  `${{ github.repository_owner }}` so it auto-adapts to any fork.
- **Media pipeline** — JPEG snapshot, YUV420 → RGB565 conversion, OV2710
  sensor bring-up path.

### Fixed

- Jitter buffer dropping multiple valid packets (increased buffer size and
  queue depth).
- OV2710 black frames (sensor detection, flip-control skip, ioctl access).
- Camera memory fragmentation (switched to USERPTR with pre-allocated SPIRAM
  buffers).
- Spinlock crash on camera deinit (race between DQBUF and close).
- Signaling cache invalidation for corrupted / empty endpoints.
- Duplicate signaling state callbacks and WebSocket reconnection after error.
- Use-after-free crash in `esp_camera` (static config, CLI registration
  before Wi-Fi wait).
- Cleanup loop abort on non-fatal errors — Wi-Fi disconnect no longer
  permanently breaks session cleanup.
- Cached TURN servers not applied to new peer connections.
- `global_media_started` not reset when session count reaches 0 — media
  restart after disconnect cycles.
- `CHECK_SIGNALING_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRATION` guard against NULL credentials
  (crash on reconnect).
- Deferred cached ICE server apply to the work queue — avoids 22 s+ stall on
  offer processing.
- Moved KVS threads to SPIRAM, fixed thread-naming collision with lwIP.

### CI and testing

- GitHub Actions build matrix for ESP-IDF v5.4 (9 example/target combos) and
  v5.5 (11 combos) using `espressif/idf` Docker containers.
- GitLab CI configuration for internal builds.
- Unit-test infrastructure on the ESP-IDF Linux host target covering base64,
  CRC32, hex encoding, signaling serializer, and state machine.
- Sphinx + Doxygen documentation build job.
- ESP Launchpad deployment workflow (GitHub Pages).

### Documentation

- Migration guide in `README.md` for users moving from the old
  `beta-reference-esp-port` branch.
- `API_USAGE.md` and `CUSTOM_SIGNALING.md` covering the simplified API and
  custom signaling protocols via the pluggable interface architecture.
- Wi-Fi provisioning instructions in example READMEs.

### Known deferred

Tracked for follow-up PRs:

- Display / video-decode path for received video (`video_player_adapter.c`
  is currently a stub).
- First-class M5Stack Tab5 support (partial commits already on `main`).
- Acoustic Echo Cancellation in the audio send path.
- ESP-IDF `release/v6.0` upgrade and CI coverage.
- Consolidation of signaling implementations into `components/`.
